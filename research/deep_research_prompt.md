**Deep Research Prompt for VinVideo Pre-Editing Video Quality Control (QC) - Revised with Document References**

**Objective:**
Identify, evaluate, and recommend state-of-the-art, computationally efficient No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) methods specifically suited for detecting common artifacts and ensuring temporal coherence in AI-generated video segments. These segments are produced by VinVideo's primary AI models (e.g., LTX Studio, WAN model) and require QC *before* being passed to our downstream AI Editor Agent for assembly with Movis. The focus is on practical, implementable solutions for a high-throughput, low-latency pipeline (target QC latency significantly less than 0.25 seconds per 60-second original video equivalent).

**Context from VinVideo's Internal Planning & Initial Research (Foundation for Deeper Investigation):**
To streamline your deep research and avoid redundant effort, this section summarizes VinVideo's current internal planning and preliminary findings. This context is intended as a starting point; a comprehensive investigation beyond these initial points is required. For further detailed context, please refer to the following accompanying documents if provided:
*   **`o3_plan.md`**: Outlines VinVideo's core engineering strategy, initial QC ideas (e.g., a two-tier approach with BRISQUE and MGSampler in Section 4), latency constraints, and overall system data flow. This document details our current high-level approach.
*   **`search_results.md`**: Summarizes findings from our initial web research on VQA techniques, highlighting promising papers (e.g., on the GHVQ metric from arXiv:2411.16619), concepts (e.g., CLIP-based coherence, optical flow), and identified resources that already require deeper investigation. This shows what we've explored superficially.
*   **`README3.md`**: Describes the overall VinVideo platform architecture, the role of different AI agents, the specific AI models used for video generation (LTX Studio, WAN) and initial image QC (QWEN-2.5 VL), and the planned multi-stage QA workflow (including pre-editing asset QA). This provides system-level context.

Key takeaways from our internal groundwork (to be expanded upon by your deep research):
1.  **Initial QC Strategy Ideas**: We are exploring a multi-tier approach, potentially starting with lightweight image quality assessments (like BRISQUE) and temporal sampling (MGSampler concept). We need validation, refinement, and identification of more advanced/robust alternatives.
2.  **Promising Research Leads**: The GHVQ metric (arXiv:2411.16619), CLIP-based coherence checks, and optical flow analysis for temporal artifacts are of high interest. Deeper understanding and practical implementation details are needed.
3.  **Pipeline Requirements**: The QC must fit into a pre-editing stage, operate with very low latency, and provide actionable pass/fail signals for an automated asset regeneration loop. Solutions must be benchmarked against these needs.
4.  **Focus on AI-Specific Artifacts**: The QC needs to be highly effective for artifacts common in videos generated by models like LTX Studio and WAN. Generic VQA may not suffice.

**Specific Deep Research Questions & Areas of Focus (This is the core request):**

Please provide detailed information, including links to relevant papers, open-source implementations (Python preferred), performance benchmarks (accuracy and computational cost, especially on GPUs like A10/H100, targeting our low-latency requirement), and summaries of techniques for the following:

1.  **GHVQ Metric (from arXiv:2411.16619, detailed in `search_results.md` and `o3_plan.md` context)**:
    *   Detailed explanation of its components: What specific "human-focused quality features," "AI-generated content-aware quality features," and "temporal features" does it measure, and how?
    *   Mathematical formulation or algorithmic description.
    *   Any public discussion, critique, or adoption of this metric.
    *   Feasibility of implementing or adapting GHVQ for VinVideo's specific needs.

2.  **CLIP-Based Video Coherence & Quality Metrics (see `search_results.md` for initial leads)**:
    *   Practical methods and open-source libraries for using CLIP (or similar models like DINOv2, SigLIP) embeddings to measure frame-to-frame or short-sequence semantic, stylistic, and object consistency.
    *   Metrics derived from CLIP scores for video QA: definition and validation.
    *   Effectiveness against common AI video artifacts (object morphing, style shifts, content drift).

3.  **Optical Flow for Temporal Artifact Detection (see `search_results.md` and `o3_plan.md` context)**:
    *   Most effective and efficient optical flow algorithms for detecting jitters, unnatural motion, or frozen areas in AI-generated videos.
    *   How to define robust metrics from optical flow fields.
    *   Performance benchmarks relevant to our latency targets.

4.  **Other Lightweight NR-VQA Models for AI Video Artifacts**:
    *   Beyond BRISQUE, identify other SOTA lightweight NR-VQA models (preferably deep learning) effective for AI video artifacts (flickering, morphing, detail inconsistency, unnatural physics).
    *   Focus on models with results on AI-generated video, available implementations, and good speed/accuracy.

5.  **Human Figure & Face Quality Assessment in AI Video (refer to GHVQ context and `search_results.md`)**:
    *   Specific, efficient metrics/models for evaluating AI-generated human figures: anatomical correctness (faces, hands), motion realism, appearance consistency.
    *   Detection of common AI artifacts on humans.

6.  **Efficient Frame Sampling Strategies for Video QA (refer to `o3_plan.md` and `README3.md` context)**:
    *   Advanced frame sampling techniques optimizing defect detection vs. speed for AI video.
    *   Content-adaptive or event-driven sampling strategies.

7.  **Comparative Analysis & Benchmarks**:
    *   Existing benchmarks comparing the above techniques on AI-generated video datasets, ideally from models similar to LTX Studio or WAN.

**Desired Output Format for Research Findings:**
*   Summaries of key techniques and models.
*   Suitability for VinVideo: pros, cons (accuracy for AI artifacts, efficiency, Python integration).
*   Links to papers, open-source code.
*   Computational requirements/benchmarks.
*   Relevant datasets for AI-generated video quality.

This research will directly inform the design and implementation of VinVideo's critical pre-editing Quality Control pipeline, as outlined in our internal planning documents (`o3_plan.md`, `README3.md`).
