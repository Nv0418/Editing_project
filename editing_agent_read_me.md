# VinVideo LLM-Based Editing Agent

## Overview

The Editing Agent is an AI-powered creative intelligence that receives structured outputs from the Director, Producer, and Prompt Engineer agents, then generates professional JSON editing plans using advanced language model reasoning. The agent leverages the Qwen-3 32B model for sophisticated decision-making and outputs compatible JSON for the existing Movis-based video rendering system.

## Architecture

### LLM-Based Pipeline

```
Agent JSON Inputs → LLM Editing Agent (Qwen-3 32B) → Validated JSON Plan → editing_agent_to_movis.py → Final Video
     ↓                        ↓                           ↓                        ↓
  Producer.json         System Message              Schema Validation         Movis Pipeline
  Director.json         Creative Rules              Format Checking           MP4 Output
  PromptEng.json        Movis Capabilities          Error Handling
```

### Input Data Flow

1. **Producer Agent JSON**: Timeline structure, shot count, clip durations per beat, asset paths
2. **Director Agent JSON**: Overall vision, tone, storytelling approach, emotional beats
3. **Prompt Engineer JSON**: Scene context, image/video prompt details for each beat

### Beat Alignment System

- Video clips labeled as `beat_01.mp4`, `beat_02.mp4`, etc.
- Consistent beat numbering across all agent JSON outputs
- LLM understands semantic mapping of beat number → content meaning

### LLM Creative Intelligence

- **Genre-aware editing**: LLM applies different editing styles based on content type
- **Contextual decisions**: AI analyzes prompts to determine action vs. dialogue scenes
- **Dynamic style adaptation**: Real-time creative decisions based on content flow
- **Human-like reasoning**: Advanced contextual understanding rather than rule-based logic

## Implementation Components

### 1. System Message Design
- Comprehensive Movis capabilities reference
- JSON schema specification with detailed examples
- Creative editing guidelines and industry best practices
- Beat alignment instructions and content analysis
- Error handling and validation requirements

### 2. JSON Schema Validation
- Exact format compatibility with `dynamic_video_editor.py`
- Comprehensive examples for different content types
- Validation framework for output quality assurance

### 3. Agent Input Processing
- Structured JSON input format for all three agents
- Flexible path-based input system
- Real agent data integration (not mock data)

### 4. Testing & Deployment
- Deploy on RunPod with Qwen-3 32B (FP16)
- Test with real agent outputs
- Validate JSON format accuracy
- Integration testing with Movis pipeline

## Key Advantages of LLM Approach

### Superior Creative Intelligence
- **Dynamic Decision Making**: Adapts to unique content combinations
